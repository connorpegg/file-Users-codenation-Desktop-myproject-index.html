<h2>1.1 The layout for the pages</h2>
<p>I have used padding for every page to make it look nice and a little cleaner I tried to make the writing as
    visible as possible with the gif background which I also used for every page. And the navigation bar i used
    a goldenrod colour to make the writing very visible with the background.</p>
<h2>1.5 The copyrights and constraints affecting websites.</h2>
<p>The main constraints that pop up is time, scope and price but that depends on the type of website that you
    are making time will affect your website no matter what kind of website you decide to make. Copyright can
    affect the website if they content that you make is similar to someone else’s work or the other way
    around since most applications are approved and you will have to pay a fee a way around this though is
    if you ask permission or if they ask for your permission. </p>
<h2>1.6 issues that may affect people with disabilities.</h2>
<p>If there are flashing images it will cause a fit for someone who has epilepsy or if someone has slight sight
    loss and they can’t zoom in on your content then they can’t read what is on the website they are visiting
    or if it is a video on a website and a person is deaf and there are no subtitles then they can’t watch the
    video since they can’t get the same experience as everyone else. </p>
<h2>1.7 The appropriate file types for websites.</h2>
<p>The appropriate file types for websites are html’s to make the websites content and css files to style your
    website to make it more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.</p>
