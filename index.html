    <h1>welcome, my name is connor pegg and this is my blog</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>about me</h2>
    <h3>I am interested in technology because I am just fascinated by what is behind the screen behind what we see. Even though I am new to coding i am still 
        willing to learn everything there is to learn about it because I think it is amazing on how little lines of code can become something as big as a game 
        or a website or even an application for a mobile. I think that there is still plenty to learn about coding but i am still trying my best to do everything 
        that i have already learnt but that is just part of the fun because no day in coding is the same as the day before so it makes it exciting for me and keeps
        me on my toes and this happens because of the challenges codenation has thrown my way.</h3>

        <h2>IT in modern businesses</h2>
        <h3>IT plays a big part of modern businesses it can show the cash flow that the business has which also allows them to save resources IT also allows the company
             to interact with their customers faster the companies websites also allows the clients to find the answers that they may have for the company and this can 
             create a stronger public image for the company. IT can show warehouse business owners the most efficient way for storage costs of holding different products.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Methods, skills and resources</h2>
        <h3>Some of the methods that you can use are the POST-it method, the MILK-it method, The JUST-CUT it method, and if you want to be creative you can use the DO-IT
             method. The most important IT skills someone can have are coding, network, time management and communication. These are the main ones that employers might 
             look for in an apprentice or an employee. There are physical IT resources such as IT infrastructure, databases,networks and software packages and applications
              where the non physical IT resources (human) are IT expertise and IT manager skills. </h3>
        <br>
        <h2>How I plan to carry out my tasks</h2>
        <h3>I plan to carry out all of my plans in the most efficient way possible by using the things that I have learnt through my time here at code nation. This means i 
            will use the methods I think will be most efficient and use the correct skills for my future projects. While I use the most efficient methods and correct skills 
            i will try to use all of the resources efficiently also. </h3>

        <h2> risks of a digital project that may lead it to fail</h2>
        <h3>One of the risks that could happen is that you could be in the middle of a project and halfway through your project a new model could be released which could
         make your website or app not work as you intended on the new device which could lead you to restart the app or website so it works correctly on the latest device and 
         the devices before. Another risk is that while you are in mid build for your website or application, another company could come out with a new feature that might drive
          away your customers which may lead for your website or application to fail.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2> the technology I would use</h2>
        <h3>The systems that I will use are software designs, databases, development for my webpages, and network so it can work online. And the softwares that I will use are html, 
            css, javascript and google docs.</h3>
