    <h2 class="title">About me</h2>
    <p class="large">I have always been interested in technology since I was young, my biggest hobby is gaming but if I had to choose a
        career I would have to choose game development. I have always enjoyed gaming since a young age my favourite childhood game was
        Spyro3:Year Of The Dragon, but I am open to a lot of games and thats how I found my new favourite game which is called Enslaved.
        I joined this coding course mainly to learn how game development is done and even though I have not made a game in the course I
        have still enjoyed what we have done on the course because it was sometimes challenging but that is the fun part of learning.
