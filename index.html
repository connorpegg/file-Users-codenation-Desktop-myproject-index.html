    <h1>Welcome, my name is Connor Pegg and this is my blog</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am interested in technology because I am just fascinated by what is behind the screen behind what we see. Even though I am new to coding i am still 
        willing to learn everything there is to learn about it because I think it is amazing on how little lines of code can become something as big as a game 
        or a website or even an application for a mobile. I think that there is still plenty to learn about coding but i am still trying my best to do everything 
        that i have already learnt but that is just part of the fun because no day in coding is the same as the day before so it makes it exciting for me and keeps
        me on my toes and this happens because of the challenges codenation has thrown my way.</h3>
