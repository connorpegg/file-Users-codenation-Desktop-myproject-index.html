        <h2>Risks of a digital project that may lead it to fail</h2>
        <h3>One of the risks that could happen is that you could be in the middle of a project and halfway through your project a new model could be released which could
         make your website or app not work as you intended on the new device which could lead you to restart the app or website so it works correctly on the latest device and 
         the devices before. Another risk is that while you are in mid build for your website or application, another company could come out with a new feature that might drive
          away your customers which may lead for your website or application to fail.</h3>

        <h2>The technology I would use</h2>
        <h3>In order for me to get the outcome that I want I will need to use certain systems either to design the project or to make notes. The systems that I will use are 
            software designs, databases, development for my webpages, and network so it can work online. And the softwares that I will use are html, css, javascript and
             google docs.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Legal guidelines and constraints</h2>
        <h3>Businesses must tell the person viewing their website that they use cookies and how you use them so the person viewing the websites content will be aware of how you use
        these cookies. Your website must also contain your company's registered address and companyâ€™s registration number. The constraints of a digital project are fairly simple
        such as time in case if you have a time limit to build it, the scope so what the outcome.
