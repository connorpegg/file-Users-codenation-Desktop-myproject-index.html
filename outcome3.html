<h2>3.1 The benefits and drawbacks of IT tools.</h2>
<p>The benefits of visual studio code is that it is easy to learn and once you have learnt how to use it you
     can be efficient with it and do projects with a decent speed. Trello’s benefits is that it has features 
     that some apps don’t have like i’ve mentioned before it has a time feature so you can set a specific time
     for yourself so you can be efficient with your work. However these tools do have drawbacks like trello takes
     time to set up with all of the tasks which uses up a lot of your time when you could be more efficient and
     with visual studio code if you have never used it it might take you some time to get used to it and if you
     have one piece of code incorrect it will affect your entire code leaving you reading your code from start
     to finish.</p>
<h2>3.2 how could I improve productivity and efficiency?</h2>
<p>The way I could have been more efficient is that I could have used the time feature on trello more often to
   keep on track with my work which would have also increased my productivity.</p>
<h2>3.3 What I would do differently next time?</h2>
<p>The thing that I would do differently is that I would be using the time feature on trello to increase my
   productivity and efficiency so I would have more time to do my code to make everything better and have
   all the features that I wanted to have.</p>
<h2>3.4 How I would test digital solutions?</h2>
<p>The way that I would test for solutions such as bugs or problems with the website is i would write the code
     that I want and then launch the html file making it easier to spot problems.</p>
