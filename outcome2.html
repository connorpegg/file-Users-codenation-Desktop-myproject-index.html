<h2 class="title">2.1 Am I happy with the tools I used?</h2>
<p class="large">Yes the tools that I used to create my website visual studio code was very useful to the creation of my
     website I used visual studio code to do my html files and my css file so I was able to style my website
     with css and create all of the content with html. Trello kept track of my progress so I knew what was
     needed to be done for that day so this was very helpful to keep me on track with the deadline.</p>
<h2 class="title">2.2 Were they useful?</h2>
<p class="large">Both tools were useful in their own ways like i said trello was useful for keeping track of time with its
    time feature letting you know an hour before the time you set for yourself if you wanted that feature
    activated and visual studio code was useful for the actual creation of the website with the css and html
    files.</p>
<h2 class="title">2.3 Am I happy with the final product?</h2>
<p class="large">I am happy with what I have created because it is what I envisioned even though there are a few improvements
   that I would have liked to have done which I will talk about in a later question and there is one problem that i also have
   i will also adress in a future question but apart from that I am very happy with the website that I have created since before
   I didn't even know how websites were created or even how to code to style a website.</p>
<h2 class="title">2.4 Further improvements.</h2>
<p class="large">As I said there are a few improvements that I wish I could have made such as the html name I know it’s not
  really necessary but still I wish I could change it. Another change I would like to have done is a wide
  range of pictures where if you scroll down it would reveal different pictures the further that you go down
  the page. The one problem that I have with my website is that every screen zooms in at different zooms
  and I dont really know why so that is something that I would like to try to sort out.</p>
<h2 class="title">2.5 Do the outcomes meet the requirements and are they fit for their purpose?</h2>
<p class="large">The outcomes for this project do fit the purpose of being there since they ask questions about the website
   itself and don’t drift off to talk about something else meaning they meet the requirements however the questions for
   the outcomes are pretty similar so you have to kind of rephrase yourself which is not neccerally a bad thing if
   someone wants to know that you understand what you are talking about. the main one that meets the requirements is
   outcome two (2.2) this one was specifically fit for the purpose of the project because it asks if the tools that you used
   were useful.</p>
